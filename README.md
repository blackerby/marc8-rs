# marc8-rs
## A library for decoding the MARC-8 charset to Unicode 

A work in progress port of the MARC-8 to Unicode transcoding logic in the venerable [pymarc](https://gitlab.com/pymarc/pymarc/-/blob/main/pymarc/marc8.py) with additional ideas drawn from [marc-record](https://github.com/demarque/marc-record) and [marc8](https://github.com/jiaola/marc8).
